Dictionary Entry &amp; Lookup\
An app created in **2013** which provides a GUI for managing a dictionary/lexicon. \
One day I got into thinking at how much is involved with inserting an entry into a dictionary.\
A dictionary is not just a collection of words with a definition.\
A dictionary is a collection of words which can contain multiple entries for different parts of speach, each having one or more definitions. It would also contain the rules for how to pronouce respective word, its etymology, homographs, variants of the word and syllable break down. Making sure to provide a character set for symbols used in defining sounds for pronounciation.\
And so I saw it as a challenge to provide a UI to manage such a collection.\
